# The end date is today Sydney time.  Sydney timezone is +10, and +11 during

# force just use +11 all the time.
#
# Obviously today's price won't be available just after midnight, so a time
# offset giving today after 9am or 4pm or some such could make more sense.
# Actually as of Feb 2009 price for a given day aren't available until the
# afternoon of the next weekday, so the end date used here is going to be
# anything from 1 to 4 days too much.  It does no harm to ask beyond what's
# available.
#
# The start date requested takes account of the slackness in the end date
# and the possibility of public holidays.  The worst case is on Tuesday
# morning.  The available price is still only the previous Friday, and if
# Thu/Fri are Christmas day and boxing day holidays then only Wednesday is
# available, and then want also the preceding day to get the prev price,
# which means the Tuesday, which is -7 days.  Go back 2 further days just in
# case too, for a total -9!
