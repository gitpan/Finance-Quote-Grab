=head1 NAME

Finance::Quote::RBA - download Reserve Bank of Australia currency rates

=for test_synopsis my ($q, %rates);

=for Finance_Quote_Grab symbols AUDGBP AUDUSD

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Finance::Quote;
 $q = Finance::Quote->new ('RBA');
 %rates = $q->fetch ('rba', 'AUDGBP', 'AUDUSD');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module downloads currency rates for the Australian dollar from the
Reserve Bank of Australia,

=over 4

http://www.rba.gov.au/

=back

using the page

=over 4

http://www.rba.gov.au/statistics/frequency/exchange-rates.html

=back

As of June 2009 the web site terms of use,

=over 4

http://www.rba.gov.au/copyright/index.html

=back

are for personal non-commercial use with proper attribution.  (It will be
noted material is to be used in ``unaltered form'', but the bank advises
import into a charting program is permitted.)  It's your responsibility to
ensure your use of this module complies with current and future terms.

=head2 Symbols

The symbols used are "AUDXXX" where XXX is the other currency.  Each is the
value of 1 Australian dollar in the other currency.  As of January 2010 the
following symbols are available

    AUDUSD    US dollar
    AUDCNY    Chinese renminbi
    AUDJPY    Japanese yen
    AUDEUR    Euro
    AUDKRW    South Korean won
    AUDGBP    British pound sterling
    AUDSGD    Singapore dollar
    AUDINR    Indian rupee
    AUDTHB    Thai baht
    AUDNZD    New Zealand dollar
    AUDTWD    Taiwanese dollar
    AUDMYR    Malaysian ringgit
    AUDIDR    Indonesian rupiah
    AUDVND    Vietnamese dong
    AUDAED    United Arab Emirates dirham
    AUDPGK    Papua New Guinea kina
    AUDHKD    Hong Kong dollar
    AUDCAD    Canadian dollar
    AUDZAR    South African rand
    AUDSAR    Saudi Arabia riyal
    AUDCHF    Swiss franc
    AUDSEK    Swedish krona

Plus the RBA's Trade Weighted Index for the Australian dollar, and the
Australian dollar valued in the IMF's Special Drawing Right basket of
currencies.

    AUDTWI    Trade Weighted Index
    AUDSDR    Special Drawing Right

The "AUD" in each is a bit redundant, but it's in the style of Yahoo Finance
currency crosses and makes it clear which way around the rate is expressed.

=head2 Fields

The following standard F-Q fields are returned

=for Finance_Quote_Grab fields flowed standard

    date isodate name currency
    last close
    method source success errormsg

Plus the following extras

=for Finance_Quote_Grab fields table extra

    time              ISO string "HH:MM"
    copyright_url

C<time> is always "16:00", ie. 4pm, currently.  The bank publishes TWI
(trade weighted index) values for 10am and Noon too, but not until the end
of the day when the 4pm value is the latest.

C<currency> is the other currency.  Prices are the value of an Australian
dollar in the respective currency.  For example in "AUDUSD" C<currency> is
"USD".  C<currency> is omitted for "AUDTWI" since "TWI" is not a defined
international currency code.  But it is returned for "AUDSDR", the IMF
special drawing right basket.

=head1 OTHER NOTES

Currency rates are downloaded just as "prices", there's no tie-in to the
C<Finance::Quote> currency conversion feature.

The exchange rates page above includes an RSS feed in "cb" central bank
format, but it doesn't give previous day's rates for the F-Q "close" field.
