Finance-Quote-Grab extends Finance::Quote to fetch quotes from

    * Casablanca Stock Exchange
    * MLC Funds
    * Reserve Bank of Australia

Quotes can be viewed in your favourite Finance::Quote program.

The prerequisites are

    * Finance::Quote
    * HTML::TableExtract (which Finance::Quote needs anyway)
    * LWP version 5.814 or higher

The Finance-Quote-Grab home page is

The Finance::Quote home page is

    http://finance-quote.sourceforge.net



To make add-on F-Q modules available you generally have to add them to
the module loads in your Finance::Quote->new call.  For example to get
the defaults plus MLC,

    my $quoter = Finance::Quote->new ('-defaults', 'MLC');

You can also set the environment variable FQ_LOAD_QUOTELET like

    FQ_LOAD_QUOTELET="-defaults Casablanca"
    export FQ_LOAD_QUOTELET

FQ_LOAD_QUOTELET is used by new() calls with no arguments.  Setting it
may be the easiest way to get new modules into an F-Q program.  For
example with the Examples/chkshares.pl script provided by F-Q,

    FQ_LOAD_QUOTELET="RBA" ./chkshares.pl rba AUDUSD
